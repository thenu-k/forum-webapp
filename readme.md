Version 04 of Cheese Kottu Forums will be created with the intention of deployment to a server.

This version will employ Node.js as the backend.

A local postgres database was created: cheese_kottu_forums

Postgres returns data in the form of:
[
  { body: 'Welcome', username: 'Thenu', img_url: 'a_url' },
  { body: 'Motherfucker', username: 'Gandalf', img_url: 'another_url' }
]

There is no need to send the CSS files manually.
